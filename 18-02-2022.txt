	* What Are Memory Leaks and what Causes it in Js and write an example to prove a memory leak?

=> Memory leaks can be defined as memory that is not required by an application anymore 

=> that for some reason is not returned to the operating system or the pool of free memory. 

=> Programming languages favor different ways of managing memory. 
   
 In generally, JavaScript memory leaks are caused by unwanted references (to objects that will never be used again). They are usually bugs in the JS code.

  Causes:-

  "The main cause for leaks in Garbage collected languages are unwanted references i.e., Mark-and-Sweep"

--> Accidental global variables
--> Forgotten timers/callbacks
--> Out of DOM references
--> Closures

example:-

const test = (array) => {
  array.push((new Array(1000000)).fill('test'));
};

const testArray = [];

for(let i = 0; i <= 1000; i++) {
  test(testArray);
}
